## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Svetlana Kuksova, previously Software Engineer transitioning into Data Science and Machine Learning.    
Originally from Russia, Iâ€™ve been living in the USA for the past 7 years. I hold both a Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics from the National Research University of Electronic Technology (2010â€“2016).

My early career as a Software Engineer  began at Rutronic Ltd, Moscow (2015 - 2018), where I worked on fingerprint matching and image processing algorithms for civilian identification systems. My goal was to integrate these algorithms into production fingerprint scanners to ensure reliable, real-time performance.   

After moving to the United States, I joined Los Alamos National Laboratory (2018â€“2020), working under my mentor, Boian Alexandrov. Under his guidance, I adapted to new scientific challenges and contributed to the development of an innovative approach to tensor decomposition.(you can read about it here). It was a fascinating and formative experience, and Iâ€™ll always be grateful to him for his warm acceptance and mentorship.   

Later, I moved to Florida, where I took a career break for family reasons and dedicated myself to professional photography. This experience helped me develop strong interpersonal and creative skills â€” learning how to provide meaningful services and make people genuinely happy.   

**Data Science**      
Later, after moving from Florida to Seattle, I continued my photography career but soon felt inspired by the surrounding tech industry to return to IT. After months of reflection, I have decided to try working as a data scientist and started studying machine learning, statistics and math. Although my academic background gave me a solid foundation, I spent time rebuilding my knowledge to deeply understand ML concepts.
During this period, I joined an AI startup as a Data Scientist Intern, where I gained valuable hands-on experience solving computer vision problems. Alongside that, I worked on numerous personal projects to strengthen my skills in Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Modeling, Evaluation, Hypothesis Testing, Business Metrics, and A/B Testing.       

While Iâ€™ve done many projects, two stand out as my personal favorites:  

+ Text-in-Image Search â€” building an intelligent visual search engine for images containing text  
+ Personalized Recommender System â€” a recommendation model for e-commerce datasets  

After this extensive learning journey, I feel ready to take on new challenges and am currently seeking Data Scientist roles. Iâ€™d be happy to connect and talk!   

**Activities**    
So I am still grasp my knowledge in Data Science (it's never ending process, right?), currently reading Statistical Thinking for Programmers and taking the Google Analytics course.  

Outside of tech, I love photography, skiing, and old Hollywood movies.
